The box was supposedly worth more than an entire star system, for it contained Parallax, the sentient embodiment of fear.

Another of their group was killed by the forest, and the others fell into a temple. Inside was an Orange Lantern Power Battery. Mesmerized by it, the three remaining thieves started fighting among themselves for the Lantern. The Guardians then arrived with a force of Manhunters. However, their power was drained by the orange light, and several Guardians and Manhunters were killed, along with a third member of the thieves, leaving only Larfleeze and Blooch remaining. The Guardians then said that all they wanted was the box containing Parallax. If the two would give it up, they would be allowed to keep the Orange Battery, as long as it stayed buried in the temple on Okaara. Additionally, only one could own the battery.
